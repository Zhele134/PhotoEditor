Hi, this is a basic photo editor that includes some fundamental photo editing functionality.
With this program, the user will be able to upload a photo and edit it with 4 main functions.
1. The user may apply filters onto their photo, including common filters such as greyscale and sepia.
2. The user may adjust the contrast, brightness, sharpness, and blur of the photo using simple and intuitive sliders.
3. The user may crop the photo by dragging a rectangle around the parts of the photo the user wishes to keep.
4. The user may transpose the photo, rotating it 90Â° left or right, or inverting it horizontally or vertically.
After the desired changes have been made, the user may save their photo into their desired location on their local
storage.

I created this project in order to learn Python, so there will be some bugs I need to iron out later.
